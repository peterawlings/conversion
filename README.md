This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run the project
  - Clone the project or download the zip, unzip it and cd into that directory.
  - Run 'npm install'
  - Run 'npm start'

  #### Instructions
  - Select a unit from each drop down and enter a number in the first input to get a result in the second.


  #### Notes

  - Second drop down removes or changes options automatically dependent on the selected option in the first
  - Standardise breakpoints - use global variables (possibly CSS varibles)
